# Client Interview Guide

**Project:** Refrog
**Team:** Team 3
**Client:** Wendy Macias, Texas Christian University
**Meeting:** This is meeting 1 of several.

---

_**What this file is.** Your script going in, your meeting record coming out. Copy it once per meeting into `docs/requirements/` as `client-interview-YYYY-MM-DD.md` and commit it the same day._

_**How to use it.** Each section says what it is for, what it is worth in minutes, and whether it must happen in this meeting. The example questions are written for a different domain (technical recruiting) on purpose, so you cannot use them unchanged. Rewrite them in your client's words before you walk in, and write the answers underneath in **their** words rather than yours._

_**Work it with your agent.** Give it your one-page brief, this file **including these instructions**, and a role: "You are an experienced business analyst preparing for a first client interview. Using the question types in this guide, write the version of each question that fits this client's domain, and list every acronym in the brief you would want defined before the meeting." Then do the part it cannot: pick which of its questions are worth your client's limited hour. **Sort by what it costs you to stay wrong**, not by what is easy to ask. Anything you could answer by reading a document is not worth a client minute._

## Listen before you build

**An idea you propose in the first twenty minutes is not worth what it costs you.** Your strongest instinct will be to show your client you understood by describing what you would build. Early, that ends the elicitation: a client who has heard your idea reacts to it instead of describing their world.

This is about order, not silence. Some clients want to think out loud with you, and a few asked for the project because they want exactly that help. Do it **after** the read-back in section 14, when you can describe their process back to them accurately and the brainstorm is grounded in their world rather than your imagination. If they open by asking for your ideas, say you have some and would rather earn them by understanding the process first, then come back to it before you leave.

**The separate rule is absolute: commit to nothing.** Not a deadline, not a feature, not "sure, we can add that". Five teammates are not in the room. "Let me write that down and bring it back to the team" is the whole sentence, and it holds even when a client pushes.

## Before you go

- [ ] **Three roles assigned.** Lead asks and moves the agenda, one person not four. Scribe writes and does not ask, capturing exact words, especially nouns. Observer watches what is not said: hesitation, the topic they keep returning to, who they defer to.
- [ ] **Everyone has read the client's pitch slides** (TCU Online) and written questions individually before you merged them. The ones two of you wrote independently are the ones to ask.
- [ ] **Shortlist sent to the client the day before.** They arrive with answers instead of promises.
- [ ] **This file open on the scribe's laptop**, with someone on paper as backup.
- [ ] **Someone owns the clock.** You will not get through this guide, and that is expected.

## Meeting record

| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | _[2026-09-10]_ |
| **Time and location** | _[TCU Moudy South 18, in person]_ |
| **Client participants** | _[Wendy Macias, Co-Founder of Refrog]_ |
| **Team participants** | _[Alexa Mercado (lead), Ananye Kejriwal (scribe), Ethan Wong (scribe), Spencer Scherger(observer), Evelyn Tran(observer), Alfonso Rodriguez-Tomax(observer)]_ |
| **Recording** | _[Asked? Granted or declined]_ |
| **Photos of screens or forms** | _[Asked? Granted or declined]_ |

_Ask to record, and say why: so nobody is transcribing instead of listening. If they decline, the scribe matters more. Ask separately about photographing screens, forms, and reports. A photo of the spreadsheet they actually use beats a page of notes about it._

## The shape of the hour

Most first meetings run 60 to 90 minutes. Budget for the short one.

| Part | Sections | 60 min | 90 min |
|---|---|---|---|
| Opening | 1 | 5 | 5 |
| The business | 2, 3 | 10 | 15 |
| The process | 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 | 25 | 40 |
| The boundaries | 9, 10, 11, 12 | 10 | 15 |
| The close | 13, 14, 15 | 10 | 15 |

**Extra time goes into section 4 first.** It repays another ten minutes and it is the only section you cannot reconstruct from notes afterward.

"Can wait" means the next meeting, not never. When you are behind, drop from the middle. **Never drop 14 or 15:** the read-back is where you learn you misunderstood something, and the close is where you stop losing two weeks to scheduling.

# Opening

## 1. Get to know your client

_**Must ask. 5 min.** Not small talk. Whose problem is this, how much of the domain lives only in this person's head, and how much of their own time do they have for you? A client fitting this around a full job answers email slowly, and you want to know that in week 3 rather than week 9._

_Adapt: Tell me about being a communication professor at TCU. What piqued your interest in founding refrog?


**What they said:**

---

# The business

## 2. Context and domain

_**Must ask. 5 min.** You are here for vocabulary as much as facts. Every term you do not recognize goes in the glossary before you leave. When your client says "cycle" in one sentence and "sprint" in the next, ask which they mean while they are still in front of you; an agent reading the transcript afterward cannot ask._

_Adapt: Give us some background on refrog. Who else is involved? Any documents, slides, or videos that would get us up to speed on the terminology?

**What they said:**

**Terms for the glossary, in their words:** _[Term: what they said it means. Flag any term two people used differently.]_

## 3. Business drivers and objectives

_**Must ask. 5 min.** Why this, why now. These become your business objectives, so push for a number: when they name a benefit, ask the follow-up nobody asks, **what is that number today?**_

_Expect to miss it here. Baselines surface in section 4, when they are looking at the thing that takes the time. Ask the objective now, listen for the number all hour, and close the gap in the read-back._

_Adapt: Did you want to have a mobile application or a web based application?

**What they said:**

**Candidate objectives (`BO-<slug>`), with baselines where you got them:** _[Or "baseline unknown, `OI-*` raised".]_

---

# The process

## 4. How it works today

_**Must ask. 10 min, the best ten in the meeting.** Ask them to show you rather than tell you. People describe the process they believe they follow; the spreadsheet shows the one they actually follow, and the gap is where the requirements hide. **"Show me" is the two most productive words in requirements engineering, and they cost nothing.**_

_Walk one real recent case end to end. "Take me through the last one you did" beats "how does it usually work", because the general shape is a summary they have given before and the last real one has the exceptions in it._

_Adapt: What are the steps end-to-end on a refrog event? Could you show me your volunteer sign up form, and how you track items? Who does what at each step?_

**What they said:** _[Numbered steps, in their order, not yours.]_

**Artifacts they showed us:** _[Spreadsheets, forms, reports, current tools, screenshots taken. Ask for copies of everything.]_

## 5. What is hard about it

_**Must ask. 5 min.** The complaint is usually the requirement. Listen for "must", "unless", "only", and "except", which arrive unannounced in the middle of a story about something else. Those sentences are business rules, and they exist whether or not your software does._

_Adapt:  Where does it get stuck? What do you do when it goes wrong?
What is the most frustrating part about your current system? Walk me through the last time it went badly. 

**What they said:**

**Rules heard (candidate `BR-*` for week 4):** _[Write each as their policy, not as software behavior.]_

## 6. What already works

_**Must ask. 3 min.** Ask what is good before you propose replacing it. A team that removes something the client liked has lost trust it will not get back this semester, and nobody volunteers this unasked._

_Adapt: Is there anything you like about reFrog currently that you wouldn't want to change? Has anything been tried before that did not work, and why?_

**What they said:** _[Explicitly: what must not change.]_

## 7. Volumes and scale

_**Must ask. 3 min.** These numbers decide most of your architecture, and they are cheap to ask for and expensive to guess. Twenty records a semester and two hundred thousand a day are different systems._

_Adapt: How many people do you expect at your events? What do you use amount of inventory and other data for? Do you seperate items donated by category?

**What they said:** _[Get a number, or record that you did not.]_

## 8. Who the users are

_**Must ask. 4 min.** The person who commissions software is often not the person who uses it._

_**If you cannot reach the real users, that is a project risk, not a scheduling detail.** Record it as an `RI-<slug>` the same day. Building from a proxy's account is the most common way a capstone ships something nobody uses, and it is survivable only if you know you are doing it._

_Adapt: Who is going to interact with the refrog app? Who is the primary user for the refrog app?

**What they said:**

**Can we reach real users? If not, why, and what is the risk:**

---

# The boundaries

## 9. Constraints and rules

_**Must ask. 4 min.** Nobody asks these in meeting 1 and everybody regrets it in November. A constraint restricts how you may build, and it is a requirement even though it describes no behavior. Ask directly; clients do not volunteer these, they assume you know._

_Adapt: 
Is there anything we are required to use, or forbidden from using when building the app?
 Does this touch personal data, student records, health information, or payments? 
 Any regulations or policies it has to satisfy? Is there a budget for hosting, and who signs off?_

**What they said:**

## 10. External dependencies

_**Must ask. 3 min.** What your system has to talk to. Access credentials take weeks to obtain, so the ask has to happen now._

_Adapt:


**What they said:**

## 11. Lifetime and who maintains it

_**Must ask. 2 min.** The question students never ask and every client can answer. **Who runs this after we graduate, and what do they already know how to run?** It constrains your entire technology choice, so ask before you pick a stack rather than after._

_Adapt:
What top features would you like to see implemented first?
How long should this keep running? Who supports it after we graduate from TCU? What do they already maintain, in what languages? Who pays for hosting next year, and who owns the accounts?_

**What they said:**

## 12. Other stakeholders

_**If there is time. 1 min.** Cheap, and occasionally it turns out somebody with a veto has not been consulted._

_Adapt: Who else could influence this, or be affected by it? Whose approval do we need?_

**What they said:**

---

# The close

## 13. Anything else

_**Must ask. 1 min.** Ask it, then stop talking and wait through the silence. Highest-yield question in the guide, and it only works if you do not fill the pause._

_Adapt: Is there anything I should have asked and did not? What have we not talked about that worries you?_

**What they said:**

## 14. The read-back

_**Never skip. 5 min.** The part teams cut when they run late, and the highest-value five minutes of the hour. Say what you understood in your own words and watch for the correction. A client who is nodding may be being polite; a client correcting you is engaged, and that correction is usually the single most useful sentence of the meeting._

_Read back four things: the problem in one sentence, the objectives with any numbers you got, the top three things you heard are hard, and one thing you believe is **out** of scope. The last produces more correction than the other three together._

_Fill in the [vision-and-scope.md](vision-and-scope.md) vision statement table during the meeting, read its six rows aloud, and see what they fix. Ninety seconds._

**What we read back, and what they corrected:** _[Corrections first. They matter more than the agreements.]_

## 15. Before you leave the room

_**Never skip. 4 min.** Unglamorous, and where teams lose two weeks._

- [ ] **Next meeting on the calendar** before anyone stands up. Not "we will be in touch". _[Date, time, place:]_
- [ ] **Cadence agreed:** how often, roughly how long, and in person or remote. This course expects meetings **in person, on campus** where your client can travel; if they are outside DFW, agree the tool and who sends the link. _[Cadence:]_
- [ ] **Contact channel and how fast they reply.** _[Channel, turnaround:]_
- [ ] **Who to contact between meetings**, including when this person is away. _[Name, contact:]_
- [ ] **Copies requested** of every artifact you were shown. _[What, and who is sending it:]_
- [ ] **Introductions requested** to anyone named in sections 8 and 12. _[Who:]_
- [ ] **Say what happens next**, in one sentence, so they know what to expect and when.

# After the meeting

_File everything within 24 hours, while you still remember why each answer mattered. This file is a record, not a home._

| Anything unanswered | [OPEN-ISSUES.md](OPEN-ISSUES.md) |

## Initial ideas

_[Solutions anyone floated, yours or theirs. Record them here and nowhere else yet. A solution the client already picked ("then I select the state from a drop-down") is not a requirement, and writing it into the specification makes a design decision on their behalf. Ask why until you reach the need underneath, then write down the need.]_

## Disagreements and hesitations

_[The observer's section, and the one that evaporates fastest. Two participants using the same word differently. A question answered by the wrong person. A topic they returned to three times. An answer that changed between the start and the end. A visible pause before "yes". None of it is evidence on its own; all of it tells you where to look next.]_

## Open questions

_[Everything you could not answer, and everything they answered with "I would have to check". Copy each into [OPEN-ISSUES.md](OPEN-ISSUES.md) as an `OI-*` with the person who can answer it, then sort them before the next meeting by what it costs you to stay wrong.]_

_**Within 24 hours**, send the client your notes and the open questions. It creates the record and gives them a second chance to correct you while the meeting is fresh. Then commit this file._
