# Architectural Design

**Project:** _[Your project name]_
**Team:** _[Team NN]_
**Client:** _[Client name and organization]_
**Version:** 0.1

_**How to use this template.** Instructions appear in italic square brackets. Fill in underneath them and leave them in place until the document is stable. Every section says which checkpoint it is due at. A section that is not due yet stays as it is; do not fill it with guesses to make the document look finished._

_**What this document is.** Your system's **architecture-of-record**: the one map of the whole system, every use case area, every component, every external system, and the few decisions that are expensive to change later. It is **breadth-complete and depth-shallow**. Every part of the system is named, and nothing is designed further than its responsibility. How one use case works inside its component is a design-of-record, which comes in week 7, one per use case area, and it is written against real code._

_**What it is not.** A second copy of your requirements. The specification says what the system must do and how well; this document says how the system is shaped to do it. It **cites** `UC-*`, `CO-*`, `SEC-*`, `PER-*` and the rest by identifier and never restates them. A threshold that appears here and nowhere in the specification is a requirement hiding in the wrong document._

_**The test for what belongs here.** Decide now what is hard to reverse, affects the whole system, and is forced by a quality attribute or a constraint: how many deployables, where the data lives, how users sign in, which external systems you depend on. Leave to per-area design what is local and cheap to change: class names, endpoint shapes, table columns._

_**Structure.** The sections follow **arc42** (Starke and Hruschka), with **C4** diagrams (Simon Brown) for context and containers, written as mermaid so they diff in git. All twelve arc42 sections are here in arc42's order, numbering, and titles. The three subsections whose content another document already owns (the requirements overview, the stakeholders, and the quality requirements overview) are kept as one-line links to that document, so the numbering matches arc42's and nothing is written twice. arc42 orders sections by topic, not by when you write them, so Checkpoint 1 covers sections 1–5, 8.1, and 9, and sections 6 and 7 come later. The full worked example is Project Pulse's [architecture-of-record](https://github.com/Washingtonwei/project-pulse/blob/main/docs/design/architectural-design.md); read it for the shape, then write your own, because your client's quality attributes are not Project Pulse's.]_

## Identifiers

_[The new identifiers this document creates. Everything else it cites keeps the identifier of the document that owns it.]_

| Space | For | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `KD-<slug>` | Key architectural decisions | `KD-single-deployable` |
| `QS-<slug>` | Quality scenarios | `QS-cross-employee-order-denied` |
| `RISK-<slug>` | Technical risks | `RISK-payroll-api-unavailable` |
| `TD-<slug>` | Technical debt the architecture knowingly carries | `TD-no-rate-limiting` |

_[Project Pulse numbers its decisions and scenarios (`KD-1`, `QS-1`). Yours use slugs, like every other identifier in your project, so an inserted decision renumbers nothing and a citation says what it points at.]_

## 1. Introduction and Goals

_Due: Checkpoint 1._

### 1.1 Requirements overview

_[Your [specification](../requirements/software-requirements-specification.md) and your [use cases](../requirements/use-cases.md) are the requirements overview. Link them here; do not summarize them.]_


The requirements overview is maintained in the [Software Requirements Specification](../requirements/software-requirements-specification.md) and [Use Cases](../requirements/use-cases.md).
### 1.2 Quality goals

_[The **three** quality attributes that most shape your system, in priority order. Pick them from section 9 of your [specification](../requirements/software-requirements-specification.md) and cite their identifiers. If you cannot rank them, ask your client which one they would give up first; that answer is the ranking._

_These are usually the top rows of the table in section 9.1, and the two do different jobs. Here, say why each goal matters to your client. There, say which decision it forces._

_Example, from the Cafeteria Ordering System:]_

| Priority | Quality goal | Specification handles | Why it shapes the architecture |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | _Payroll data stays confidential_ | _`SEC-payroll-auth`, `SEC-employee-own-orders`_ | _Orders are paid by payroll deduction, so an order record carries an employee's pay account. A leak is a legal problem, not a bug._ |
| 2 | _Orders placed before 10:00 are not lost_ | _`ROB-order-persisted`, `AVL-lunch-window`_ | _The lunch rush is the only load that matters, and a lost order is a hungry employee with a payroll charge._ |
| 3 | _Cafeteria staff can run it without IT_ | _`CO-no-dedicated-ops`, `MNT-menu-self-service`_ | _Nobody on the cafeteria side can deploy, restart, or patch anything._ |

| Priority | Quality goal | Specification handles | Why it shapes the architecture |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Phone-first participant workflows are quick and accessible | `USE-mobile-responsive`, `USE-donation-completion`, `USE-volunteer-signup-completion`, `USE-validation-feedback`, `USE-accessibility` | Donors, shoppers, and volunteers use the system in busy, distributed event locations. The PWA must work directly from a QR code without making donation or shift sign-up burdensome, while centralizing the workflows that currently use SignUpGenius and QR-code Google Forms. |
| 2 | Shopper affiliation and administrative data are protected | `SEC-authenticated-administration`, `SEC-role-based-access`, `SEC-least-privilege`, `SEC-affiliation-data`, `SEC-transport-encryption`, `SEC-authentication-provider` | Shoppers are verified through their TCU email, while only Wendy Macias, Courtney Hendrix, and Erick Trevino administer event data. The architecture must keep verification and administrative functions separate from public participant workflows. |
| 3 | ReFrog information and essential workflows remain available during event operations | `AVL-event-hours`, `AVL-uptime`, `AVL-fallback-information`, `AVL-outage-recovery` | A service outage during volunteer recruitment or a live event prevents shift coverage, location information, donation logging, and shopping records. The architecture needs reliable hosting, backups, and an accessible outage fallback. |

### 1.3 Stakeholders

_[Your stakeholders are profiled in section 3.1 of [vision and scope](../requirements/vision-and-scope.md). Link it here; do not copy it.]_


Stakeholders are profiled in [Vision and Scope](../requirements/vision-and-scope.md#31-stakeholder-profiles).

## 2. Architecture Constraints

_Due: Checkpoint 1._

_[The constraints the architecture has to honor. They are already written as `CO-*` in section 2.4 of your specification, and `OE-*` in section 2.3; **list the identifiers here, do not restate them.** Add one sentence only where a constraint narrows an architectural choice in a way that is not obvious from its text._

_Your technology stack is a constraint only if something external fixes it: the client's IT department, an existing system, or the person who maintains this after you graduate. A stack your team chose is a decision, and it goes in section 9 with the alternative you rejected.]_

The architecture must honor the following operating-environment requirements: `OE-mobile-location-access`, `OE-in-person-event-support`, and `OE-decentralized-tool-replacement`.

The applicable design and implementation constraints are `CO-nontechnical-administration`, `CO-tcu-it-approval`, `CO-tcu-accessibility`, `CO-tcu-data-governance`, `CO-approved-branding`, and `CO-operational-ownership`.

**Unresolved production hosting.** The team and client have not selected a production hosting provider. `CO-azure-database-hosting` and `CO-tcu-application-hosting` remain conditional constraints pending the client's comparison of TCU-managed hosting with an outside option and any required TCU IT decision. This uncertainty is tracked by `DE-tcu-azure-hosting` and `DE-operational-ownership`.

## 3. Context and Scope

_Due: Checkpoint 1._

_[One C4 context diagram: your system as a single box, every kind of user, and **every external system** it talks to (email, payment, an identity provider, a client database, an LLM, a file store). An external system discovered halfway through the build is a schedule risk you could have seen at the start._

_Your specification already lists the external systems. Every system named in a software interface (`SI-*`, section 8.3), a communications interface (`CI-*`, section 8.5), or a dependency (`DE-*`, section 2.5) is a box here. A box with none of those behind it is an interface your specification is missing, so add it there too._

_This is your project's one context diagram. Section 4.1 of [vision and scope](../requirements/vision-and-scope.md) holds the first draft: redraw it here in C4, then replace the drawing there with a link to this section, so there is one diagram to keep current._

_arc42 divides context into a **business context** (who and what crosses the boundary) and a **technical context** (the channels and protocols). This diagram is the business context. The protocols go on the arrows of the container diagram in section 5.1._

_The **trust boundary** is not drawn here. You name it in writing in section 8.1, as Project Pulse does._

_Example:]_

```mermaid
C4Context
    title System Context: Cafeteria Ordering System

    Person(patron, "Patron", "Employee ordering a meal")
    Person(staff, "Cafeteria Staff", "Prepares and delivers orders")
    Person(menu, "Menu Manager", "Maintains the daily menu")

    System(cos, "Cafeteria Ordering System", "Takes, prepares, and delivers meal orders")

    System_Ext(payroll, "Payroll System", "Deducts meal payments from pay")
    System_Ext(sso, "Corporate Sign-On", "Authenticates employees")
    System_Ext(email, "Corporate Email", "Order confirmations")

    Rel(patron, cos, "Orders meals")
    Rel(staff, cos, "Fulfils orders")
    Rel(menu, cos, "Edits menu")
    Rel(cos, payroll, "Submits payment requests")
    Rel(cos, sso, "Verifies identity")
    Rel(cos, email, "Sends confirmations")
```

## 4. Solution Strategy

_Due: Checkpoint 1._

_[Three to five bullets: the few moves that shape everything else. arc42 suggests four kinds: the technology you build on, how the system is divided at the top level, how the quality goals in section 1.2 are met, and any organizational choice that shapes the code (who maintains what, what you buy instead of build)._

_Each bullet is one sentence, and it cites what explains it: the key decision in section 9.2 where one exists, and otherwise the quality goal and the building block in section 5 it shapes. Keep it short; the reasoning lives in section 9. A bullet that cites nothing is either not load-bearing, or it is a decision you have not written down yet._

_Example:]_

- _**One deployable with one managed database** (`KD-deployment-shape`), because nobody on the cafeteria side can operate infrastructure (quality goal 3)._
- _**Payment is the only component that talks to the Payroll System** (section 5.2), so payroll data crosses the trust boundary in exactly one place (quality goal 1)._
- _**Divided by use case area**, Ordering, Menu, and Delivery, each owning its own rules, so a menu change never touches ordering code (quality goal 3, `MNT-menu-self-service`)._

## 5. Building Block View

_Due: Checkpoint 1. This section is most of what your TA checks._

### 5.1 Containers

_[One C4 container diagram: the separately running or separately stored pieces inside your system box. For most projects that is a front end, a back end, and a database, and sometimes a file store. Name each container's technology. Every external system from section 3 appears again here, attached to the container that talks to it._

_Label every arrow with what it does and the protocol it uses ("Sends confirmations [SMTP]"). Those protocols are arc42's technical context._

_Under the diagram, one or two sentences on **why the system is divided this way**, citing `KD-deployment-shape`. A reader who sees three containers should not have to guess why there are not seven._

_Three containers is a normal answer. If you have more than five, check each one against section 9: which decision, driven by which quality attribute, requires it to run separately?_

_Example:]_

```mermaid
C4Container
    title Container Diagram: Cafeteria Ordering System

    Person(patron, "Patron", "Employee ordering a meal")
    Person(staff, "Cafeteria Staff", "Prepares and delivers orders")
    Person(menu, "Menu Manager", "Maintains the daily menu")

    System_Boundary(cos, "Cafeteria Ordering System") {
        Container(web, "Web Front End", "Vue.js", "Ordering, menu, and fulfilment screens in the browser")
        Container(app, "Application", "Java / Spring Boot", "Every business rule; serves the front end")
        ContainerDb(db, "Database", "PostgreSQL", "Orders, menus, and delivery slots")
    }

    System_Ext(payroll, "Payroll System", "Deducts meal payments from pay")
    System_Ext(sso, "Corporate Sign-On", "Authenticates employees")
    System_Ext(email, "Corporate Email", "Order confirmations")

    Rel(patron, web, "Orders meals", "HTTPS")
    Rel(staff, web, "Fulfils orders", "HTTPS")
    Rel(menu, web, "Edits menu", "HTTPS")
    Rel(web, app, "Calls", "JSON/HTTPS")
    Rel(app, db, "Reads and writes", "JDBC")
    Rel(app, payroll, "Submits payment requests", "not yet known: RISK-payroll-api-unavailable")
    Rel(app, sso, "Verifies identity", "OpenID Connect")
    Rel(app, email, "Sends confirmations", "SMTP")
```

_The system is one application and one database because nobody on the cafeteria side can operate more (`KD-deployment-shape`). The front end is a separate container only because it runs in the browser; it ships inside the application's package._

### 5.2 Use case areas and components

_[One row per use case area in your [use cases](../requirements/use-cases.md), taken from the area column of [traceability.md](../traceability.md) section 1, plus one row per **cross-cutting component** that no single area owns (authentication, notifications, file handling, an integration with an external system). A use case area with no row is a part of your system with no home; a component with no area and no cross-cutting reason is one nobody asked for._

_**Responsibility** is one sentence, what the component owns, not how it works. **Depends on** names other components and external systems, never classes. **Status** is `provisional` until the component has been built through at least one use case, and `proven` after that. At Checkpoint 1 every row is `provisional`; Checkpoint 2 turns at least one to `proven`._

_Project Pulse's component tables also name each component's package. They can because its code exists; yours does not yet, so a row here is a name and a responsibility, and packages come with the design-of-record in week 7._

_Example:]_

| Use case area | Component | Responsibility | Depends on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _`ORD`_ | _Ordering_ | _Owns an order from placement to cancellation, and the cut-off rules_ | _Menu, Payment, Identity_ | _provisional_ |
| _`MNU`_ | _Menu_ | _Owns daily menus and item availability_ | _Identity_ | _provisional_ |
| _`DEL`_ | _Delivery_ | _Owns delivery slots and the staff's fulfilment queue_ | _Ordering, Notification_ | _provisional_ |
| _(cross-cutting)_ | _Payment_ | _The only component that talks to the Payroll System_ | _Payroll System_ | _provisional_ |
| _(cross-cutting)_ | _Identity_ | _Maps a signed-on employee to a role_ | _Corporate Sign-On_ | _provisional_ |
| _(cross-cutting)_ | _Notification_ | _Sends every email the system sends_ | _Corporate Email_ | _provisional_ |

_[Check before Checkpoint 1: every area in your use case file appears in the first column, and every external system in section 3 appears in some Depends on cell.]_

## 6. Runtime View

_Due: Checkpoint 2. [One sequence diagram, for the use case your proving slice builds, from the user's action through every container and external system it touches. Leave this section empty until the slice exists; a sequence diagram of code nobody has written describes a guess._

_Draw it as a mermaid `sequenceDiagram`, and name the participants exactly as the containers in section 5.1 name them. If the use case calls an external system, show what happens when that system fails or does not answer; arc42 counts error scenarios among the most useful runtime views. Under the diagram, a sentence or two on anything a reader would not guess from it. Cite the use case by its `UC-*` identifier; do not restate its steps.]_

## 7. Deployment View

_Due: Checkpoint 3. [Filled in once your pipeline exists, after week 11. Three things:_

- _**Where each container runs.** Every container in section 5.1 is mapped to the host, service, or device it runs on, in each environment you have (at least development and production). A table is enough; a diagram helps once there are more than two hosts._
- _**How a change gets there.** From a merged pull request to production: what builds it, what tests it, and where it is released first._
- _**What survives a restart.** Which state is in the database or a file store, and which is lost when the application restarts._

_Section 4.4 of [vision and scope](../requirements/vision-and-scope.md) says who can operate the system and where its users are. Cite it; this section says how the deployment meets it.]_

## 8. Crosscutting Concepts

### 8.1 Security

_Due: named at Checkpoint 1, detailed at Checkpoint 2._

_[Four short paragraphs. The last three each cite the `SEC-*` requirement they answer:_

- _**Trust boundary:** the line between what you control and what you do not. Name the container that is the boundary and what sits outside it (the browser, every external system). Every request that crosses it is authenticated and authorized, and it covers every path your deployable answers, framework endpoints included. Project Pulse's Security & Compliance section shows the shape in three sentences._
- _**Authentication:** how a user proves who they are, and who issues the credential (your system, the client's sign-on, a third party)._
- _**Authorization:** the roles, and the rule for what a user may see beyond their role (a patron sees only their own orders). The second part is where most real breaches happen._
- _**Sensitive data:** what personal or regulated data the system stores, in which container, and which external systems receive any of it. How long it is kept and how it is disposed of are already in section 7.4 of your specification; cite them._

_Secrets (passwords, API keys, connection strings) never appear in this document or in the repository. Say where they will live, not what they are.]_

### 8.2 Other concepts

_Due: when they appear. [Error handling, logging, validation, time zones: anything every component must do the same way. Add a subsection the first time two components would otherwise do it differently.]_

## 9. Architecture Decisions

_Due: the table and one decision at Checkpoint 1; more as they are made._

### 9.1 Architecturally significant requirements

_[Not every requirement shapes the architecture. The **architecturally significant requirements** are the few that do: quality attributes and constraints where a wrong guess costs a redesign, not a bug fix. Functionality can be delivered by many structures; these are what choose among them._

_Your quality goals from section 1.2 are usually the top rows; cite them by identifier and do not explain them again. This table can also hold what is nobody's goal but still forces structure, such as a `CO-*` constraint._

_List three to six, ranked by importance to your client times difficulty to achieve. Reuse the specification's identifiers, never new ones. **At least one row is a `SEC-*` attribute.** Every system your team builds this year holds some personal data, and if no security requirement appears here, that data's protection was never designed; it will be added later, which is where security bugs come from.]_

| Rank | Requirement | Specification handles | Importance × difficulty | Drives |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | _Payroll data confidential_ | _`SEC-payroll-auth`_ | _High × Medium_ | _`KD-payment-isolated`_ |

### 9.2 Key decisions

_[One entry per key decision (`KD-*`), in the form below; it is what the wider industry calls an architecture decision record (ADR). Checkpoint 1 requires exactly one: **`KD-deployment-shape`**, whether your system ships as one deployable or several, and why. Every team makes this decision, and it is where over-engineering usually shows up first. Add others when you make them; do not invent them to fill the section._

_A decision without a **rejected alternative** is not a decision, it is a description. Name what you did not do and why not, so the next person does not redo the argument._

_A decision that turns out wrong is not deleted or rewritten. Mark it **Superseded by `KD-<new-slug>`** and write the new decision as its own entry, so the reasoning behind both stays readable._

_Example:]_

**`KD-deployment-shape`: one deployable.** _Accepted._

- **Driving requirements:** _`CO-no-dedicated-ops`; `AVL-lunch-window`._
- **Context:** _About 400 patrons, one lunch peak a day, and nobody on the client side who can operate infrastructure._
- **Decision:** _The front end is built into the back end's package and ships as one container to one host, with one managed database._
- **Rejected:** _Separate services for ordering, menu, and delivery. They would add network calls, three deployments, and failure modes between them, to solve a scaling problem 400 users do not have._
- **Trade-off:** _The system scales only as a whole, and a bad deploy takes all of it down._

## 10. Quality Requirements

### 10.1 Quality requirements overview

_[Section 9 of your [specification](../requirements/software-requirements-specification.md) is the overview. Link it here; do not copy it.]_

### 10.2 Quality scenarios

_Due: one scenario at Checkpoint 2; one per top-ranked requirement in section 9.1 by Checkpoint 3._

_[A quality attribute says how good; a scenario says how you will know. Each one is: a **source** does a **stimulus** in an **environment**, the system gives a **response**, and a **measure** tells you it worked. The measure cites the specification's attribute for its number; it never introduces one._

_**Verified by** names the test, or the repeatable manual check, that shows the measure holds. Leave it empty until that test exists; an empty cell is an honest "not yet verified".]_

| ID | Source and stimulus | Environment | Response | Measure | Verified by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| _`QS-cross-employee-order-denied`_ | _A signed-on patron requests another patron's order by its ID_ | _Normal operation_ | _Refused before any order data is read_ | _Every such request is refused and returns no order fields (`SEC-employee-own-orders`)_ | _An integration test that signs in as one patron and requests another patron's order_ |

## 11. Risks and Technical Debt

_Due: Checkpoint 2, kept current after._

_[**Technical** risks and debt only. Business risks are `RI-*` in [vision and scope](../requirements/vision-and-scope.md); do not copy them here. Project risks, such as a teammate dropping the course, belong in neither document. Seed this list from the technical `RI-*` items and from any [OPEN-ISSUES.md](../requirements/OPEN-ISSUES.md) entry whose answer could change the architecture._

_A **risk** might happen: an external system you have never called, a client dataset you have never seen. **Debt** has already happened: a shortcut you took on purpose and intend to pay back. Each row says how you would find out, or how you would fix it._

_A risk written as a category ("security", "performance") is not a risk. Write the mechanism: what fails, and what that breaks.]_

| ID | Type | What could go wrong, and what it breaks | Mitigation or fix | Cites |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _`RISK-payroll-api-unavailable`_ | _Risk_ | _Nobody has seen the Payroll System's interface. If it only accepts a nightly batch file, ordering cannot confirm payment at order time._ | _Ask for the interface document at the next client meeting; build Payment against a stub until then._ | _`DE-payroll-integration`, `OI-4`_ |

## 12. Glossary

_[Domain terms live in your [project glossary](../requirements/project-glossary.md). Link it and add nothing here unless you need an architecture term your team uses in a special sense.]_

---

## Working this document with your agent

_[Delegate: drawing the C4 diagrams in mermaid from your use case list and your specification's interfaces; checking that every use case area has a component and every external system has a component that depends on it; checking that every identifier this document cites exists in the document that owns it; drafting the rejected alternative for a decision you have already made._

_Keep human: the ranking in section 9.1 and every `KD-*`. The decisions are the part of this document your client and the team that inherits this system will hold you to, and they depend on facts about your client that are not in any file._

_**The specific failure to watch for: over-engineering.** Ask an agent for an architecture and it will propose the one it has seen most often in writing, which is built for a company a thousand times your size: microservices, a message queue, Kubernetes, a cache in front of a database that holds ten thousand rows. Every one of those is a real answer to a problem you do not have, and each one adds something that can break at 2 a.m. with nobody to fix it. For every container and every decision the agent proposes, ask which requirement in section 9.1 forces it. If the answer is none, cut it.]_
